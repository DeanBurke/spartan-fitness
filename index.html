        <div id="powerlifting-bodybuilding-info" class="powerlifting">
            <h3>Benefits of powerlifting</h3>
            <p>Powerlifting training using heavy weights and lower repetitions is incredibly beneficial — even for non-competitive lifters.</p>
            <p>A few of the potential benefits of powerlifting training are meeting performance-based goals and increased functional strength and bone density.</p>
            <h3>Benefits of bodybuilding</h3>
            <p>Bodybuilding is an excellent way to build muscle and improve your fitness, even as a non-competitive individual.</p>
            <p>While bodybuilding and powerlifting training techniques overlap at times, the main benefits of bodybuilding include building muscle, focusing on nutrition, and incorporating more aerobic exercise.</p>

        <div id="crossfit-info" class="crossfit">
            <h3>Benefits of CrossFit</h3>
            <p>The high-intensity, multi-joint movements in CrossFit may help you gain muscle strength and stamina. </p>
            <p>Adding additional weight to your workouts can further increase muscle gain by adding stress to your muscles.</p>
            <p>CrossFit workouts often include functional exercises, or exercises that mimic movements you do in everyday life.</p>
            <p>Functional movements, such as squats, kettlebell swings, or overhead presses, can help improve agility, balance, and flexibility.</p>
            <p>On average, a 195-pound male or 165-pound female will burn 15 to 18 calories per minute and 13 to 15 calories per minute, respectively, during a CrossFit circuit.</p>

        <div id="cardio-info" class="cardio">
            <h3>Benefits of Cardio</h3>
            <p>Steady-state cardio is generally more suitable for a wider group of people than HIIT(such as CrossFit) since it’s lower in intensity.</p>
            <p>teady-state cardio exercise is one of the best forms of exercise to fight stress, as it’s been linked to reduced cortisol (stress hormone) levels.</p>
            <p>Cardio exercise is one of the most effective ways to improve your heart health.</p>
            <p>It helps lower blood pressure and clears the arteries by improving cholesterol levels.</p>
            <p>This reduces your risk of blood clots, stroke, high blood pressure, and heart disease.</p>
